# knowledge-bases
Contains the multi-modal knowledge-bases from the CompMusic project.

This repository will soon be updated with data, code and results concerning the last chapter of my PhD thesis. It primarily consists of python notebooks, raw multi-modal data (or links to such) and the resulting (continually updated) knowledge-base dumps in different formats.
